## Features

---

### ‚öõÔ∏è **_`NextJS + Tailwind + Typescript` - Powered_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
<a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">NextJS</a> is a framework that allows you to build fast, modern, and accessible websites. Pairing it with <b>Typescript</b> allows to write code that's much less prone to errors and that can autocomplete to greatly enhance the Developer Experience.
<br />
<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind</a> is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you build custom layouts with a minimal amount of effort. It also pairs really nicely with NextJS and allows to create styles that are very easy to control and customise.
</p>
<br />

### üöÄ **_Fetching from the Poke-Node API_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
There are many solutions to collect data regarding Pok√©mon, and I chose the <a href="https://gabb-c.github.io/pokenode-ts/#/" target="_blank">Poke-Node-TS</a> API for its stability, typescript code and documentation. It's a REST API that allows you to query the Pok√©mon database and get the information you need, from sprites to stats.
</p>
<br />

### üß† **_Random Pok√©mon Behaviour_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
The Pok√©mon are randomly generated and animated, with the aim of creating a fun and relaxing experience for the user. Their movement is randomic and they have an <b>idle animation</b>.
<br />
When interacted with (clicking them with the mouse) they will bounce happily and have a random emoji speech bubble over their head. This will also open a 'Stats' drawer with some info about them.
</p>
<br />

### üåóüé∂ **_`Light/Dark` Mode & Background `Chill Music`_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
The app has a <b>light/dark mode</b> that can be toggled with the <b>üåö</b> button. Some <b>chill music</b> can also be played with the <b>üîà</b> button.
</p>
